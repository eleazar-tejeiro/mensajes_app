# Java App with MySQL Database

This is a mini Java application that allows users to connect to a MySQL database. The database has two tables, a User table and a Message table. Users must first login or sign up before being able to use the application. Passwords are encrypted with MD5 hash for security.

The application has complete CRUD functionality for both users and messages. This allows users to create, read, update, and delete data within the database. The user interface is simple and intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the application.
